# Strands Evals Infrastructure (CDK)

AWS CDK infrastructure for the Strands Evals Dashboard and Evaluation Pipeline.

## Architecture

### DashboardStack
- **S3 Bucket** (`strands-agents-internal-evals-dashboard`): Hosts static dashboard assets
- **CloudFront Distribution**: CDN with HTTPS, SPA error handling
- **Lambda@Edge**: Basic authentication for dashboard access (credentials injected at deploy time)
- **Secrets Manager** (`strands-evals/dashboard-auth`): Stores dashboard auth credentials
- **Origin Access Control**: Secure S3 access via CloudFront only

### EvalPipelineStack  
- **SQS Queue** (`strands-evals-trigger`): Triggers evaluations
- **Lambda Function** (`strands-evals-runner`): Runs post-hoc evaluations
- **Secrets Manager** (`strands-evals/langfuse`): Stores Langfuse credentials

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v18+)
2. **AWS CLI** configured with credentials
3. **AWS CDK CLI**: `npm install -g aws-cdk`
4. **Docker** (required for Python Lambda bundling - must be running during deployment)
   - If using **Podman** instead of Docker: `export CDK_DOCKER=podman`

## Setup

```bash
cd cdk-evals
npm install
```

## Deployment

> **Note:** Docker must be running before deploying. The Python Lambda function uses Docker to bundle pip dependencies in a Lambda-compatible environment.

### Deploy All Stacks

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Deploy Individual Stacks

```bash
# Dashboard only
npm run deploy:dashboard

# Eval Pipeline only (requires DashboardStack)
npm run deploy:pipeline
```

### First Deployment Steps

1. **Bootstrap CDK** (one-time per account/region):
   ```bash
   cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT_ID/us-east-1
   ```

2. **Create the dashboard auth secret** (before first deploy):
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager create-secret \
       --name strands-evals/dashboard-auth \
       --secret-string '{"username":"your-username","password":"your-secure-password"}' \
       --region us-east-1
   ```

3. **Deploy stacks** (credentials are fetched from Secrets Manager at deploy time):
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. **Update Langfuse credentials** (required for eval pipeline):
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
       --secret-id strands-evals/langfuse \
       --secret-string '{"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY":"sk-...","LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY":"pk-...","LANGFUSE_HOST":"https://your-langfuse-host.com"}'
   ```

> **Note:** Dashboard auth credentials are read from Secrets Manager at CDK synth time and injected into Lambda@Edge. The secret must exist before deployment. If it is missing or unreadable, synthesis fails so the dashboard is never deployed without configured credentials.

## Stack Outputs

After deployment, the following outputs are available:

### DashboardStack
- `BucketName`: S3 bucket for dashboard assets
- `DistributionId`: CloudFront distribution ID
- `DashboardUrl`: Public URL for the dashboard

### EvalPipelineStack
- `QueueUrl`: SQS queue URL for triggering evaluations
- `LambdaFunctionArn`: Eval runner Lambda ARN
- `SecretArn`: Langfuse credentials secret ARN

## Usage

### Triggering Evaluations

Send a message to the SQS queue:

```bash
aws sqs send-message \
    --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ACCOUNT_ID/strands-evals-trigger \
    --message-body '{"session_id":"your-langfuse-session-id","eval_type":"github_issue"}'
```

Supported `eval_type` values:
- `github_issue`
- `release_notes`

### Dashboard Authentication

Credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager (`strands-evals/dashboard-auth`) and injected into Lambda@Edge at deploy time.

**How it works:**
1. CDK reads the secret from Secrets Manager during synthesis (using AWS CLI)
2. Credentials are injected into the Lambda@Edge code
3. The Lambda is deployed with the baked-in credentials

**To update credentials:**
```bash
# 1. Update the secret
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
    --secret-id strands-evals/dashboard-auth \
    --secret-string '{"username":"new-username","password":"new-password"}'

# 2. Redeploy to inject new credentials into Lambda@Edge
npm run deploy:dashboard
```

> **Important:** Credentials are baked into the Lambda function at deploy time. You must redeploy after changing the secret for changes to take effect. The secret must exist before deployment; otherwise synthesis fails and the stack is not deployed.

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Synthesize CloudFormation templates
npm run synth

# Show diff against deployed stacks
cdk diff

# Destroy all stacks
npm run destroy
```

## Lambda Code

### Basic Auth (`lambda/basic-auth/`)
Node.js Lambda@Edge function for CloudFront viewer-request authentication.

### Eval Runner (`lambda/eval-runner/`)
Python Lambda function that:
1. Receives SQS messages with session IDs
2. Fetches session data from Langfuse
3. Runs evaluations using strands-agents-evals
4. Exports results to S3

## Adding New Evaluators

To add new evaluation types:

1. Update `lambda/eval-runner/handler.py`:
   - Add new evaluator imports
   - Add to `DIRECT_MODE_EVALUATORS` list
   - Handle new `eval_type` values if needed

2. Update `lambda/eval-runner/requirements.txt` if new dependencies are needed

3. Redeploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:pipeline
   ```
